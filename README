R scripts used for QC and burden analysis
. BurdenX.R = perform burden analysis of CNVs in x chromosome (males only)
. Burden_EAS.R = perform burden analysis of CNVs in EAS samples
. Burden_EUR.R = perform burden analysis of CNVs in EUR samples
. CNVQC.R = perform CNV QC
. Forest_Freq.R = perform sensitivity analysis by stratifying burden analysis by frequency bins
. Forest_Freq_EAS.R = perform sentitivity analysis by stratifying burden analysis of EAS samples by frequency bins
